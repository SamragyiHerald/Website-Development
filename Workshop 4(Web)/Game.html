    <p>PUBG is short for PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, which means “battleground for the unknown player”. The game was born out of a mod for Arma 3, and at the time was called PlayerUnknown’s Battle Royale. Its creator, Brendan Greene, was approached in 2016 by South Korean developer Bluehole, who showed interest in developing a game based on the concept.Thus, “PlayerUnknown’s” comes from the nickname of Brendan Greene, while “Battlegrounds” was the name chosen by Bluehole to replace “Battle Royale”. The developer cannot use the name commercially, as Battle Royale is the name of a Japanese film released in 2000. Currently, PUBG is under the responsibility of PUBG Corp., a subsidiary of Bluehole.In PUBG, each game has up to 100 players simultaneously. Everyone fighting against everyone to receive the most coins in the game and to be able to exchange for the items. The most important thing, according to experts, is to receive the glory of the “winner, winner, chicken, dinner”.</p>
